1. Each student gets one packet.
2. The difference between the number of chocolates given to the students having packet with
   maximum chocolates and student having packet with minimum chocolates is minimum. (distributing
   packet with max no. of chocolate is not required)
Example :[2,5,7,1,3] and students : 3
if gives 5,7,3 -> diff of 7-3 = 4 -> not correct
if gives 1,2,3 -> diff of 3-1 = 2 -> correct
logic :
sort the element
take 2 pointer and move second one to no. of student
keep track of min diff b/w first and second pointer
